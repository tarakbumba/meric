 Meric README FILE
************************
== About and Features ==

 Meric is a package helper for Arch Linux. It can retrieve packages from official repositories and Arch User Repository (a.k.a. AUR).

 Meric is a fork of famous "packer" which is developed by Matthew Bruenig <matthewbruenig@gmail.com>

 Meric is born from the needs of the autor.

 Meric has a few differences from packer:

  1- Meric has a config file. Users may use it for daily meric tasks instead of using options in commandline. Also makepkg options can be set there.
 Once options have been set; meric can call makepkg with these options by default.

 2- Meric has the ability of remove installed dependencies after package creation. Like "makepkg -r".
   Not perfect but it works for my needs.

 3- Meric can skip checking and installing from specified repositories with "--skip-repo" option. This is useful when you setup your custom repository

 with AUR packages. Aur helpers, including packer, won't treat those packages as aur packages because it thouhgt that they came from a repo (your custom repo)
 So those packages always skipped when AUR updates checking phase. This option prevents this for you.( also can be set in meric.conf to make it default behaviour)

 4- Meric can use translations. For the sake of keep package and its dependencies minimal; only one text file (in bash script format) is used to hold and provide
 all translations. See TRANSLATIONS section.

 5- Meric can call pacman with a custom pacman.conf file for all pacman related operations. Just place your custom pacman.conf under $HOME/.config/meric/ directory.

 For detailed options information type "meric --help" (without quotes) on commandline.

 == Installation ==

 * Use provided PKGBUILD from AUR to create a Meric package
  or
 * Use below commands as root in Meric directory for manual installation (you must manually remove those if you want to remove Meric):

  # cp meric /usr/bin/
  # mkdir /usr/share/meric && cp {meric.lang,COPYING,README,ChangeLog} /usr/share/meric/
  # cp meric.conf /etc/


 *************************************

 == Translations ==
 Please use the meric.lang as a template. Do not change the format. Just translate lines after "=" equal sign and do not change variables format i.e:

  Text to translate:
   ERROR11="Package \`$package' does not exist on aur."

  Translated text:
   ERROR11="\`$package' paketi AUR üzerinde yok."

 Send your translations (including your names and e-mails) to my e-mail adress shown below.
